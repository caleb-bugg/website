# About me
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley. My advisor is Professor [Dorit S. Hochbaum](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~hochbaum/). Currently, my main interest is designing algorithms for discrete decision-making, particularly in transportation. Other research interests are dynamic optimization problems and the synthesis of optimization and machine learning.

I have previously worked as a data scientist intern for [Uber](https://uber.com), the airline [KLM](https://klm.com), and the data analytics consultant [MIcompany](http://micompany.nl/).
