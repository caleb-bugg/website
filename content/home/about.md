# About me
I am a fifth-year PhD student in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley. My advisor is Professor [Dorit S. Hochbaum](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~hochbaum/). I am also working on an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (Computer Science).

I am passionate about solving challenging decision-making problems using tools from combinatorial optimization, particularly in the field of transportation. Other interests include online/dynamic optimization problems, with uncertainty about the future, and problems on the interface of optimization and machine learning.

Previously I worked as a Data Scientist for the ride-sharing company [Uber](https://uber.com), the airline [KLM](https://klm.com), and the data analytics consultant [MIcompany](http://micompany.nl/).
