Hello, my name is Caleb Xavier Bugg ([cv](files/cv.pdf)) and I am an Operations Analyst at Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere, Inc. [(ROSE)](https://www.breastfeedingrose.org)) in Decatur, GA. 

My work seeks to discover and implement quantitative methods which have a social-, civic-, and/or government-based applicatons. I hope to prescribe simple solutions that we as a global community can implement. Utilizing the math and statistical models native to Operations Research and Management, I synthesize topics that provide an analytical basis for our society to invest in long-term, social good projects.
