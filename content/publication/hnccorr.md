abstract = "Calcium imaging has emerged as a workhorse method in neuroscience to investigate patterns of neuronal activity. Instrumentation to acquire calcium imaging movies has rapidly progressed and has become standard across labs. Still, algorithms to automatically detect and extract activity signals from calcium imaging movies are highly variable from lab to lab and more advanced algorithms are continuously being developed. Here we present HNCcorr, a novel algorithm for cell identification in calcium imaging movies based on combinatorial optimization. The algorithm identifies cells by finding distinct groups of highly similar pixels in correlation space, where a pixel is represented by the vector of correlations to a set of other pixels. The HNCcorr algorithm achieves the best known results for the cell identification benchmark of Neurofinder, and guarantees an optimal solution to the underlying deterministic optimization model resulting in a transparent mapping from input data to outcome."
